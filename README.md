# Overview

Welcome! This tutorial demostrate the use of C++ language developing a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations with error handling for invalid inputs.

You can find a demo video in the following link:

# Development Environment

In this tutorial I used: 
* Visual Studio Code 
* C++ extension for Visual Studio Code v.1.20.5
* MinGW-w64 v.13.2 C++ compiler


# Useful Websites

Helpful tutorials:

- [Download MinGW-w64 ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites)

# Future Work

In the future I would like to:

- Add a feature to allow users to recall and reuse previous calculation results from the history. 
- Expand the calculator's capabilities by adding more arithmetic operations.
- Create a more user-friendly interface.
